# Bundled FFmpeg — license and source offer

Anki Miner's downloadable binaries (Linux AppImage and `.deb`, Windows
installer, macOS bundle) ship with a static build of
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org). These builds
are licensed under the **GNU General Public License, version 3** — the full text
is in [`COPYING.GPLv3`](COPYING.GPLv3).

## What is bundled, and what is not

| Distribution | Bundles FFmpeg? |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Linux AppImage | yes |
| Windows installer | yes |
| macOS bundle | yes |
| `.deb` package | yes |
| `pip` / `pipx` install | no — uses ffmpeg from the system / PATH |

The `pip` and `pipx` installs do not contain FFmpeg, so the GPL source offer
below does not apply to them.

## Upstream build sources

The bundled binaries are pre-built static builds taken from:

- **Linux & Windows** — [BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds),
  release tag `autobuild-2026-05-31-13-22`, FFmpeg version
  `n8.1.1-9-g58d4114d36` (the `gpl-8.1` variant).

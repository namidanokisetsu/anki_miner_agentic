"""Static tripwire against reintroduced GUI-thread-blocking calls.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The ``gui-freeze-hardening`` branch moved a batch of slow, synchronous
operations (ffprobe probes, registry scans + sqlite opens during processor
construction, blocking sqlite stats reads, ASR/CUDA probes, retry-loop rmtrees)
OFF the GUI thread, behind ``anki_miner.gui.utils.run_off_thread.run_off_thread``
or a worker ``QThread``. Run on the GUI thread, each of these freezes the UI —
exactly the "Not responding" class of bug the branch fixed.

This test scans the GUI source for those known-blocking patterns and asserts
that every file still containing one is in a curated, justified :data:`ALLOWLIST`.
The allowlist records the *legitimate* remaining occurrences: a call that now
runs inside a ``run_off_thread`` work callable / a worker thread, a deliberately
cheap probe, or a documented unavoidable cost. Anything NEW (a pattern in a file
not on the allowlist) fails the test with an actionable message.

THE CONTRACT (intended friction — read before "fixing" a failure)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
When this test fails it means a scanned GUI file gained one of the blocking
patterns. EITHER:

* The new call genuinely runs on the GUI thread and is not cheap → it is a
  regression. Move it off the GUI thread via ``run_off_thread`` (or a worker),
  the way ``single_episode_tab._probe`` / ``analytics_tab._fetch`` do. Do NOT
  allowlist it.
* The new call runs off-thread (inside a ``work`` callable / worker) OR is
  genuinely cheap / unavoidable → add ``"<relative/path.py>"`` to that pattern's
  set in :data:`ALLOWLIST` WITH a one-line comment explaining why.

The match key is ``(pattern, file)``, never a line number, so legitimate code
moves inside a file don't churn the allowlist.

SCOPE
-----
Scans ``anki_miner/gui/widgets`` and ``anki_miner/gui/controllers`` recursively.
``anki_miner/gui/workers`` is intentionally EXCLUDED — workers run off the GUI
thread, so blocking there is the whole point. Test files are not scanned.

A note on docstrings/comments: the scan is textual, so a pattern mentioned only
in a docstring or comment (e.g. the many ``_curation_event.wait()`` references)
still counts as a hit for its file. Those files are allowlisted anyway — a
mention in prose cannot block the GUI thread, and excluding comments would make
the scanner brittle. The allowlist comment notes when an entry is prose-only.
Because of this textual matching, several allowlist entries exist only because a
*prose* mention of the pattern inflates the file's hit set — not because of a
live call. Patterns must also be single-line: a regex spanning two source lines
(e.g. registry construction on one line and ``.load()`` on the next) matches
nothing, so such cross-line shapes are deliberately not patterns here.

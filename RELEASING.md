# Releasing Anki Miner Agentic

Maintainer-facing release SOP. Contributors should not need to run any of these steps.

## Prerequisites

- Push access to `namidanokisetsu/anki_miner_agentic`.
- A PyPI trusted publisher configured for the `anki-miner-agentic` project and this repository; releases publish via `publish.yml` on tag push.
- The pinned `vendor-libmpv-*` assets mirrored into this repository, with their URLs and SHA256 values updated in `release.yml`.
- No outstanding regressions in `## [Unreleased]` of `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `gh` authenticated with scopes `actions:write` + `actions:read` + `contents:read` (classic `repo`), needed for the dry-run gate below.

## Preflight (run BEFORE tagging)

The release workflow only runs on a `v*` tag push, so a build or smoke failure is
discovered *after* the tag is public (this is how v2.7.1 shipped broken — a bundled
`av` module the ASR smoke caught only in CI). Run the local preflight first:

```bash
scripts/release_preflight.sh                 # full Linux mirror: build + smokes + AppImage + .deb
scripts/release_preflight.sh --skip-package  # fast ~2min path: build + smokes only
```

It mirrors the Linux release job (isolated `.[asr]` venv + pinned PyInstaller,
SHA-verified ffmpeg/alass vendor fetch, PyInstaller build, then the bundle smokes
via `scripts/bundle_smoke.sh` — the same script CI runs) and must print
`PREFLIGHT ALL GREEN` before you tag. It cannot reproduce the Windows (Inno Setup,
from-source bootloader) or macOS arch-native ffmpeg steps; those stay CI-only.

The smokes it runs are pure-Python import checks, so import/collection failures
surface on Linux identically to Windows/macOS. It deliberately **skips the
whisper.cpp/pywhispercpp Vulkan loadability leg**: that leg asserts a
Vulkan-enabled `pywhispercpp` loads out of the bundle, and `pywhispercpp` is in
the `[asr-vulkan]` extra, not `[asr]` — the release job installs `[asr]` and then
replaces it with a wheel built from source against the Vulkan SDK. The preflight
installs `[asr]` alone, so the leg could only ever report a missing backend.
**`scripts/release_dryrun.sh` is what proves it**, and it fails closed if that leg
reports SKIP on either the Linux or the Windows job — so a green preflight is not
a substitute for a green dry-run.

For a full-matrix rehearsal without cutting a release, run the dry-run gate. Requires
`gh` authenticated with scopes `actions:write` + `actions:read` + `contents:read`
(classic `repo`):

```bash
scripts/release_dryrun.sh                 # default: linux-windows
scripts/release_dryrun.sh all             # all four legs (run once, green, right before tagging)
```

After the first compatible Windows release exists, run the gate with
`REQUIRE_WINDOWS_UPGRADE_SMOKE=1` so an upgrade-test skip fails the rehearsal.

It dispatches the real `release.yml` build matrix via `workflow_dispatch` (`gh
workflow run --ref <branch>`). Dispatch is a dry-run by construction — the `ci-gate`
and `release` jobs are `push`-only and `publish.yml` has no dispatch trigger, so it
cuts **no tag, no GitHub Release, and no PyPI upload**. After a green build it proves
those negatives and that the Vulkan smoke actually executed, then prints `RELEASE
DRY-RUN GREEN`. Two preconditions: the dispatch-enabled `release.yml` must be on the
default branch (`main`), and the branch under test must be pushed to origin. Re-run
and fix until green before tagging.

## Steps

1. **Sync the version string.** Confirm `anki_miner/__init__.py:__version__` matches the tag you intend to push. The release workflow validates this and refuses to publish on mismatch (Issue #10).

2. **Roll the changelog.** In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`. Add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` at the top with empty `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` / `### Removed` placeholders so the next contribution has somewhere to land.

3. **Commit and push to `main`.**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Tag and push.**

   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   > **Both `release.yml` and `publish.yml` gate on green CI for the exact tagged
   > commit** (`release.yml:82-133`, `publish.yml:19-61`) before doing anything else.
   > `ci.yml` triggers only on push/PR to `main`, never on tags, so each gate polls
   > the GitHub API for a `ci.yml` run on that SHA: up to 300s grace for the run to
   > appear, then up to 1800s (30 min) for it to finish. Tag a commit that already
   > has a green CI run on `main` (step 3 above pushes one) — tagging one that
   > never ran CI stalls for up to 30 minutes and then fails, requiring a re-tag.

5. **Release workflow runs.** On the tag, `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds per-OS artifacts:

   - Linux: PyInstaller bundle, AppImage, `nfpm`-built `.deb`.
   - Windows: PyInstaller bundle, Inno Setup installer.
   - macOS (arm64): PyInstaller bundle.
   - macOS (Intel, `macos-15-intel`): PyInstaller bundle, without the `[asr]` extra (see the Intel-macOS note below).

   Each Linux/Windows/macOS build runs `scripts/bundle_smoke.sh` — the bundle smokes (youtube extractor registry, offline ASR native-lib resolution, libmpv presence and dlopen, ffmpeg encoder set, and a whisper.cpp/pywhispercpp Vulkan import-loadability gate — a Linux+Windows-only native loadability check, skipped on macOS and in the local preflight), the same script the preflight runs. Artifacts upload to the GitHub Release for the tag.

   Windows installer CI also runs three legs: leg 1 clean-installs with no optional tasks, leg 2 clean-installs with default tasks, and leg 3 overlays the new installer onto the newest eligible older release before probing a blocked downgrade. Leg 3 may emit `no-releases` only when the release listing is empty, or `no-eligible-version` when no published stable older `vX.Y.Z` release has the exact matching Windows installer asset (including asset-name drift); these skips are legitimate for an initial Agentic release.

6. **PyPI publish runs.** `.github/workflows/publish.yml` builds and publishes the sdist + wheel to PyPI via trusted publishing on the same tag.

7. **Verify the Release page.** Check that all expected assets attached:

   - `AnkiMiner-*-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`
   - `anki-miner_*_amd64.deb`
   - `AnkiMiner-*-Setup.exe`
   - `AnkiMiner-macOS-arm64.tar.gz`
   - `AnkiMiner-macOS-x86_64.tar.gz`

   And that PyPI lists the new version: <https://pypi.org/project/anki-miner-agentic/>.

   > **Intel macOS build is special.** The `AnkiMiner-macOS-x86_64.tar.gz` build runs on
   > GitHub's `macos-15-intel` runner and ships **without local Whisper ASR**: it installs
   > the base package (no `[asr]` extra) because faster-whisper hard-requires onnxruntime,
   > which dropped all macOS x86_64 wheels at 1.20 (the last Intel-mac builds need numpy<2,
   > but the lock pins numpy 2.x), making `[asr]` unresolvable there. The app degrades
   > gracefully — ASR probes via `find_spec` and the Subtitle Generation tab reports it
   > unavailable. The asr bundle smoke is skipped on this job (`BUNDLE_SMOKE_SKIP_ASR=1`).
   >
   > **Runner lifespan.** The earlier `macos-13` runner was retired on 2025-12-04 — a
   > retired label gets no machine and the job queues forever (this hung the v2.7.1/v2.7.2
   > releases). `macos-15-intel` is GitHub's last x86_64 Actions image, served only through
   > ~August 2027. Before then, drop the Intel matrix entry (ship macOS arm64-only). Do not
   > use a `-large` runner variant.

8. **Smoke-test one installer.** Run the installer for at least one OS (typically the AppImage on Linux for speed). Confirm the GUI launches and a sample mine completes end-to-end.

   > **Windows installer.** With `SetupLogging=yes`, logs are written to `%TEMP%\Setup Log*.txt`.
   > `SetupMutex` blocks a second Anki Miner installer while one is already running.

9. **Announce.** Wherever you announce releases (Discussions, social, etc.). The in-app update banner picks the new release up automatically on every user's next launch.

## Vendored libmpv (video preview)

Release bundles ship libmpv from the repo-owned `vendor-libmpv-*` GitHub release, fetched by pinned URL + SHA256 in `release.yml`. The assets are produced by manually dispatching the **Vendor libmpv** workflow (`.github/workflows/vendor-libmpv.yml`): Linux builds a static-ffmpeg `libmpv.so.2` via mpv-build, Windows mirrors zhongfly/mpv-winbuild's `libmpv-2.dll` (upstream retention is ~30 days — that's why we mirror), macOS bundles the Homebrew closure via dylibbundler + ad-hoc re-sign. Each artifact carries LICENSE + `SOURCES.txt` (exact upstream versions, GPL source-offer bookkeeping; see `licenses/libmpv/README.md`).

Cadence: re-run ~2-3x/yr when a new mpv stable ships, or immediately on an mpv/ffmpeg security advisory. After publishing a new `vendor-libmpv-*` release, update the pinned URLs + SHA256s in `release.yml` (the fetch steps fail closed on mismatch) and run the release dry-run.

## Antivirus false positives (Windows)

The Windows build is an unsigned PyInstaller bundle shipping `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`, so Microsoft Defender (and other engines) periodically flag it as malware. It is always a false positive. When a flag is reported after a release:

1. Download the flagged `AnkiMiner-*-Setup.exe` from the Release.
2. Submit it at <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission> under "software developer" / incorrectly detected as malware. Microsoft threat researchers re-evaluate and de-list, usually within hours to a couple of days.
3. For other engines reported (ESET, Avast, etc.), submit to that vendor's false-positive portal.

The build is already hardened against the common heuristics — no UPX, embedded PE version metadata, and a PyInstaller bootloader forced to rebuild from source by `PYINSTALLER_COMPILE_BOOTLOADER=1` (see `anki_miner.spec` and `release.yml`). The durable fix is Authenticode code signing (planned via SignPath Foundation's free OSS program); signed builds accrue Defender/SmartScreen reputation so the flagging stops recurring per release.

## Recovering from a bad release

- **Workflow failed mid-publish**: the tag is on the remote but artifacts are incomplete. Delete the GitHub Release (not the tag), fix forward, push a new patch tag (`vX.Y.Z+1`). Do not retag the same version — PyPI rejects re-uploads.
- **PyPI accepted a broken wheel**: yank the version on PyPI (`pip` skips yanked releases unless a user explicitly pins to it), then publish a patch release with the fix.
- **Update banner pointing at broken release**: the banner reads the GitHub Release API. Marking the GitHub Release as a draft hides it from the banner until you re-publish a fixed version.

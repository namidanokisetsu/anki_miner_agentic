    Per-kind population contract:

    * kind="mokuro": the detector fully populates every field from the
      ``.mokuro`` JSON — ``title`` (= series), ``volume`` (= episode), and
      ``image_root`` (archive file Path for .cbz/.zip-backed volumes,
      directory Path for dir-backed, None for text-only). Loaders trust these.
      Two OCR placements: ``ocr_entry`` is None when ``path`` IS the sidecar
      ``.mokuro`` file on disk; for a self-contained archive (Issue #103) the
      ``.mokuro`` JSON lives *inside* the archive — then ``path`` and
      ``image_root`` are both the archive and ``ocr_entry`` names the member.
    * kind in {"epub","txt","subtitle"}: the detector sets ``title`` =
      ``path.stem`` (a provisional label for queue rows only), ``volume`` =
      None and ``image_root`` = None; the loader is authoritative for the
      final ``ReadingDocument`` metadata.
    * kind="text": built directly by the Text sub-tab, never by the detector —
      ``text`` holds the pasted content, ``title`` = "Text", and ``path`` /
      ``volume`` are None. ``image_root`` is the ONE optional card image the
      user picked — an image *file*, unlike mokuro's page directory/archive
      root — which the loader hangs on every unit as a single shared
      ``ImageRef``, the way epub shares a cover; None means imageless cards.
      Distinct from kind="txt", which is a ``.txt`` *file* on disk (aozora
      loader).

    this) and only None for kind="text".

        Args:
            video_file: Path to video file.
            subtitle_file: Path to subtitle file.
            progress_callback: Optional progress callback.
            curation_callback: Optional callback for word curation. Receives
                filtered words. Returns the user-selected subset (an empty list
                means "confirmed with nothing selected" → a completed run with
                zero new cards), or ``None`` if the user cancelled/rejected the

            episode_name_override: Optional override for the episode identity
                passed to stats_service. When ``None`` (default) the identity
                is derived from ``video_file.stem`` (preserves current file-based
                flow). Used by ``process_youtube_url`` to record
                ``YT:<video_id>``.
            series_name_override: Optional override for the series identity
                passed to stats_service. When ``None`` the identity is derived
                from ``video_file.parent.name``.
            audio_track_override: Optional 0-indexed audio track to extract instead of
                auto-detecting Japanese. None (default) preserves existing JP auto-detect behavior.
            source_label_override: Optional override for the card "source" field
                origin. When ``None`` (default) the origin is built from the
                resolved series/episode identity as ``"<series> — <episode>"``
                (em dash, U+2014). Used by ``process_youtube_url`` to stamp the
                actual video title instead of the synthetic ``YT:<video_id>``.
            audio_only: If True (audiobook mining), media extraction skips
                per-word screenshots and reuses the file's embedded cover art
                instead. False (default) preserves existing video behavior.
            cancel_event: Optional threading event set by a worker on
                cancellation. When provided it is bridged into this run's
                phase checkpoints and the media extractor's cancelled_check
                (via :attr:`cancelled`) for the duration of this call only —
                workers must use this instead of the sticky :meth:`cancel`,
                which poisons shared processors across runs (see __init__).

        Returns:
            ProcessingResult with statistics.

        Raises:
            SetupError: note type / field mapping is misconfigured, or no usable

        """Mine a loaded reading document (manga volume / novel) into Anki cards.

        Mirrors :meth:`process_episode`'s skeleton over ``ReadingDocument``:
        text-unit parse (phase 1') → filter (phase 2) → image materialization +
        expression audio (phase 3') → definitions (phase 4) → cards (phase 5).
        Video-only steps (ffmpeg extraction, audio-stream cache invalidation)
        are omitted. Each ``document.warnings`` entry (text-only volume, unusable
        cover, unmatched pages) is surfaced up front via
        ``presenter.show_warning`` so load-time degradations stay visible.

        Args:
            document: The loaded document to mine.
            progress_callback: Optional progress callback; wraps only phases
                3'/4/5 in a single weighted sweep.
            curation_callback: Optional per-word curation callback; same
                semantics as :meth:`process_episode`.
            cancel_event: Optional worker cancel event, bridged into this run's
                checkpoints for its duration only (see __init__).

        Returns:

        caller's responsibility, typically in a ``try/finally``.

        Episode identity recorded to stats_service is ``YT:<video_id>`` with
        series ``YouTube`` so that YouTube mining rows never collide with
        file-based folders that happen to share a stem.

        Args:
            url: YouTube video URL (or anything yt-dlp accepts).
            video_id: Pre-extracted video_id; must match the ID yt-dlp will

            sub_mode: "manual_only" or "auto_only" — chosen by the user based
                on what probe_metadata reported as available.
            fallback_allowed: Forwarded to the fetcher. When True (the worker
                passes ``VideoInfo.has_auto_ja_subs``), a ``manual_only`` fetch may
                fall back to the video's *native* auto-captions if the listed manual
                track is unavailable at download time. Gated on the probe's verdict
                so the fallback can never reach a machine-translated track.
            cancel_event: Threading event set by the worker on cancellation;
                forwarded to the fetcher so in-flight yt-dlp can be killed,
                and passed through to ``process_episode``, which bridges it
                into the mining pipeline's cancellation checkpoints (via
                :attr:`cancelled`) for the duration of this run only.
            progress_callback: Optional ``ProgressCallback`` forwarded to
                ``process_episode`` for mining-phase reporting (media extract,
                definitions, card creation).
            fetch_progress_cb: Optional ``(label, frac)`` callable forwarded
                to ``YouTubeFetcherService.fetch_video`` for download-phase
                reporting. ``frac`` is in [0.0, 1.0] or ``None`` for
                indeterminate stages (merging, post-processing).
            curation_callback: Optional callback for word curation. Forwarded
                unchanged to ``process_episode``; see its docstring for semantics.
            on_fetched: Optional callback invoked with the ``FetchedMedia``
                result after download completes, before the mining pipeline
                starts. Called on the calling thread (the worker thread).
            source_label: Optional origin string for the card "source" field
                (typically the YouTube video title). Forwarded to
                ``process_episode`` as ``source_label_override``. The stats/dedup
                identity (``YT:<video_id>`` / ``YouTube``) is unaffected.

"""Central resolver for the alass executable.

Resolution order (first hit wins):

1. **Config override** — ``config.alass_location`` when set and runnable.
2. **Bundled** — inside a PyInstaller frozen bundle, ``sys._MEIPASS/bin/alass``
   (``alass.exe`` on Windows, otherwise ``alass``).
3. **Managed** — an in-app-downloaded binary at ``config.bin_root/alass``
   (``alass.exe`` on Windows). Installed by ``services.alass_installer`` for
   source/pip users who lack a bundled copy.
4. **PATH fallback** — the bare literal ``"alass"``.

The frozen-detection idiom mirrors ``anki_miner.gui.resources.get_resource_dir``.

Returning the bare literal (rather than an absolute ``shutil.which`` path) in the
non-frozen / no-override case is intentional: it preserves the historical behavior
that existing subprocess tests assert (``cmd[0] == "alass"``).

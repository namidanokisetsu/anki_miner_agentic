"""Lightweight wall-clock instrumentation for pipeline phases.

The mining pipeline had no per-phase timing at all — only the whole-run
``ProcessingResult.elapsed_time`` — so costs like the two-ffmpeg-per-word
extraction (OVH-049, media_extractor.py) stayed unquantified. ``timed_phase``
wraps one phase call and logs its duration to ``anki_miner.log`` at INFO;
developer-facing only, never surfaced through the presenter.

Phase granularity only: never wrap per-word hot loops — the log line itself
would become the overhead.

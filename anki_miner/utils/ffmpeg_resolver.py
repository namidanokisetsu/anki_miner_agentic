"""Central resolver for the ffmpeg/ffprobe executables.

Resolution order (first hit wins):

1. **Config override** — ``config.ffmpeg_location`` / ``config.ffprobe_location``
   when set and the file actually exists.
2. **Bundled** — inside a PyInstaller frozen bundle, ``sys._MEIPASS/bin/<name>``
   (``ffmpeg.exe`` / ``ffprobe.exe`` on Windows, otherwise ``ffmpeg`` / ``ffprobe``).
3. **PATH fallback** — the bare literal ``"ffmpeg"`` / ``"ffprobe"``.

The frozen-detection idiom mirrors ``anki_miner.gui.resources.get_resource_dir``.

Returning the bare literal (rather than an absolute ``shutil.which`` path) in the
non-frozen / no-override case is intentional: it preserves the historical behavior
that existing subprocess tests assert (``cmd[0] == "ffmpeg"``).

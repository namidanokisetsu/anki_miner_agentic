"""Parse known-word exports from external tools into a set of written forms.

Feeds the Manage Known Words "Import…" flow: users migrating from jpdb,
Migaku, AnkiMorphs (or with a plain word list, e.g. ad-hoc WaniKani exports)
bulk-load their known vocabulary as ``known_words.db`` ``source='user'`` rows.
Pure module — no Qt; runs inside a ``run_off_thread`` work callable.

Format signatures were verified against upstream sources (2026-07); if an
import misbehaves years later, check these for drift before touching the
detection order:

- jpdb review export (JSON shape + grade enum): two independent consumers,
  github.com/llvtt/jpdb_anki_import (jpdb.py) and
  github.com/daryll-ko/jpdb-stats (README schema). jpdb has no known-flag, so
  known-ness is derived from the latest review grade with an EXCLUDE-list —
  an unrecognized/future grade (e.g. never-forget markers) defaults to
  *include*, so enum drift fails safe.
- AnkiMorphs headers: exporter source constants ``"Morph-Lemma"`` /
  ``"Morph-Inflection"`` / ``"Occurrence"`` in
  ankimorphs/known_morphs_exporter.py @ github.com/mortii/anki-morphs.
- Migaku Word Exporter JSON/CSV (``Word,Reading,Language,Status``, status
  ``KNOWN``): README/source of github.com/mh-343/migaku-word-exporter
  (Migaku removed its built-in export).
- Migaku legacy add-on backup ``[[word, int], …]`` (2 = known, 1 = learning):
  raetsel migration walkthrough + Migaku-legacy-guides repo.

Stored form is the written form as exported (食べる), matching the
``mined_form`` keying convention — never re-lemmatized here.

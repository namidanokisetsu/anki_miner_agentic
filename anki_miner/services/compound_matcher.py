"""Dictionary-attested compound matching (Yomitan longest-match principle).

Fragment fix (走り出した mined as 走り, 応急処置 split into 応急+処置): MeCab/
unidic short-unit tokens are mined per token, so multi-token dictionary words
never surface whole. Yomitan never fragments because the DICTIONARY defines
word boundaries — it generates candidates longest-first, deinflects, and ranks
matches by source length. This module adapts that to whole-line mining: scan
positions come from MeCab tokens, and deinflection is delegated to MeCab (the
span's tail token contributes its ``orthBase`` dictionary form).

Runs AFTER ``morphology.merge_compound_suffixes``. For spans of adjacent
tokens starting at a structurally contentful token, the longest span whose
candidate string is an exact offline-dictionary headword is merged into one
synthetic token; consumed tokens are skipped (greedy left-to-right, like
Yomitan's scan).

Lives outside ``morphology.py`` because the matcher is a stateful object — it
holds a mutable existence cache and an injected lookup dependency — unlike
morphology's pure stateless token helpers. Import direction:
``compound_matcher`` imports from ``morphology``; ``subtitle_parser`` imports
from both.

        The reading pipeline (manga volumes / novels / per-cue subtitles) hands
        mined text as ``ReadingUnit``s — one paragraph, manga text block, or
        subtitle cue each — instead of a subtitle file. Each unit's ``text`` is
        normalized for tokenization (the same ``normalize_for_tokenization`` +
        ``standardize_kanji_variants`` the subtitle path applies via
        ``clean_subtitle_text`` — mokuro OCR emits Kangxi radicals and halfwidth
        katakana that otherwise mis-tokenize), and that normalized form becomes
        the card sentence. There is no re-windowing, no pysubs2 and no per-file
        line cache on this path. ``unit.index`` (document order) doubles as the
        dummy start AND end time, so ``duration`` is ``0.0`` and every
        duration-based optional filter is inert by design.

        When ``subtitle_cleanup`` is set (the Reading→Subtitles per-cue path),
        each normalized unit additionally gets the subtitle-only annotation strip
        + user regex filter the video path applies via ``_clean_line_text``
        (:423–426), config-gated and order-identical; a cue that collapses to
        empty is skipped, so a whole-line SFX caption produces no word, no count,
        and no line-index entry. Manga/OCR and book units leave it ``False`` and
        are byte-identical to before.

        One tokenize pass per unit: ``_build_line_state`` tokenizes once and both
        the returned Counter and the emitted words reuse its ``merged_tokens``.
        The Counter accumulates over ``_iter_token_spans`` (NOT the raw
        ``merged_tokens``) so a span-undroppable token is excluded from the count
        exactly as it is from mining — the T-38 mine-vs-count consistency guard
        (see ``count_lemmas`` / ``_iter_token_spans``). Emission flows through
        ``_emit_line_words_and_index`` so mining_base folding and lemma-tail
        stripping are inherited, never re-implemented here.

        Args:
            units: Ordered reading units (only ``.text``/``.index`` are read).
            want_line_index: When True, build the per-unit ``LineLemmas`` index
                (i+1 filter input) alongside the words; when False the index
                element of the returned tuple is ``None``.
            subtitle_cleanup: When True (Reading→Subtitles cue kind), apply the
                subtitle-only annotation strip + user regex after normalization,
                mirroring the video path's ``_clean_line_text``; a cue that

        Post-acceptance REJECT layer (runs AFTER ``_should_include_word`` accepts)
        closing the katakana tokenizer-fragment junk class (デット←アンデット,
        ベア←アイスベア glossed "increase in basic salary", live-audit 2026-07):
        when an unknown katakana name/compound is short-unit segmented, its
        dictionary-matching pieces (ベア, レッド, ヒヒ are real JMdict headwords)
        clear ``should_include``'s >=2-char katakana floor. Attestation cannot
        catch them — the only signal is positional: the token sits INSIDE a longer
        unmerged katakana run in the raw line.

        Active ONLY with an offline dictionary wired, gated on the compound matcher
        (the seam that is ``None`` without a dict). Rationale: without a dict the
        matcher (see ``compound_matcher.merge_line``) can never merge a legit full
        run (スマホケース-class) into one synthetic upstream, so this positional
        rule would then reject BOTH halves of every real unspaced compound. No
        dict ⇒ returns ``False`` ⇒ mining is byte-identical to pre-guard behavior.

        A ``CompoundSyntheticToken`` is never a fragment: its span IS the merged
        full run (the matcher ran in ``_build_line_state`` before this guard), so
        it is exempt even when an unmerged katakana neighbor abuts it
        (アンデッド|ゾンビ — the synthetic survives, the residual ゾンビ is dropped).

        Rejects when the surface is all-katakana AND the raw-text char immediately
        adjacent on either side CONTINUES the katakana run (``_continues_katakana_run``:
        a katakana-block char covering ー/ッ, but NOT the author-inserted separators
        ・/゠). Whitespace, ・, ゠ or any non-katakana between katakana does NOT
        continue a run — アイ ウォン stays two tokens, アイス・ベア keeps both halves,
        スマホ|と|バッグ keeps バッグ. An all-katakana verb is exempt only when the
        existing guarded front fold proves a non-katakana common headword
        (ゲーム|ヤラれた → やる); a front that stays katakana gets no exemption.
        Deliberate precision-over-recall (plan-decided): an attested katakana word
        abutting an unbroken run (アイス|ベア) is rejected, and legit adjacent
        loanword bigrams whose full run is no headword lose both halves — no
        independent-attestation carve-out.

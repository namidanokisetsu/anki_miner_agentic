"""Google Translate TTS expression-audio fetcher.

Synthetic text-to-speech fallback for word pronunciation audio, backed by the
``gtts`` (Google Translate TTS) library. Slotted into the audio chain AFTER
JPod101 (native recorded audio); this only fills gaps where no real recording
exists.

Design notes mirroring :class:`JPod101AudioFetcher` with deliberate
differences:

* **Fed the reading (kana), never the kanji.** Synthesizing from the kana
  reading guarantees correct pronunciation and sidesteps kanji homograph
  misreads (e.g. 辛い → からい vs つらい). An empty/whitespace reading therefore
  skips synthesis entirely.
* **No ``.miss`` negative-cache markers.** Unlike JPod101, synthetic TTS
  effectively always succeeds for valid input; any failure is transient
  (network / HTTP 429 rate limit) and must be retried on the next run, so no
  negative marker is ever written.
* **Never raises.** The Phase-3 pipeline loop that calls ``fetch`` has no
  try/except by design, so this fetcher owns all error handling and returns
  None for any unresolvable word.

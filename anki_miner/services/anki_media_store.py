"""Media upload pipeline for AnkiConnect: batched ``storeMediaFile`` actions.

Split out of ``AnkiService`` so the chunk-budget logic and dict-media src
resolution are unit-testable without HTTP mocks. ``AnkiMediaStore`` owns the
shared upload path used by both card media (screenshots/audio) and
dictionary-bundled assets referenced from definition/glossary HTML:
``_build_store_media_action`` → ``_chunk_media_actions`` (count + byte
budget) → ``_store_media_chunk`` (per-file fallback on a failed ``multi``
POST).

``store_batch`` streams: filenames are deduplicated first (cheap, no I/O),
then base64 encoding happens lazily inside ``_stream_encode_chunks`` as each
chunk is assembled, so only one chunk's worth of encoded data (~4 MB) is
resident in memory at a time.  ``_chunk_media_actions`` is kept for the
``upload_dict_media`` path which pre-builds actions before chunking.

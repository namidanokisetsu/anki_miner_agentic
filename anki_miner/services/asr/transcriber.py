    #    the next window, killing runaway loops (あら×22, 何を×14).
    #  * word_timestamps=True — REQUIRED: it unlocks hallucination_silence_threshold
    #    (faster-whisper only applies that gate when word timestamps are on) and
    #    snaps each segment's start/end onto real word boundaries. Do NOT remove it
    #    as "unused": nothing else references it, but dropping it silently disables
    #    hallucination_silence_threshold and loosens every subtitle boundary.
    #  * hallucination_silence_threshold — skips long silent gaps; works even
    #    without VAD (the bundle path).
    #  * temperature=0.0 — collapse Whisper's decode-temperature fallback ladder to
    #    greedy, so the same media transcribes to the SAME text run-to-run (the app
    #    re-mines media and de-dups on episode identity; a nondeterministic
    #    transcript would defeat that). Note: _is_junk_segment drops
    #    compression_ratio > 2.4 UNCONDITIONALLY — everywhere, NOT only out of
    #    speech (the extra out-of-speech-corroborated arm in
    #    _is_nonspeech_ct2_segment is on top of, not a replacement for, that
    #    unconditional drop). With the fallback ladder collapsed a high ratio no
    #    longer means "already retried and failed", so this is an accepted aggressive
    #    junk filter: a genuinely repetitive line above the ratio is dropped too.
    #  * vad_filter=False — DELIBERATELY OFF. With it ON, faster-whisper removes
    #    silence, transcribes the concatenated speech, then restores the timeline;
    #    Whisper groups words across removed silences into one segment whose restored
    #    start/end SPAN the gap (the multi-minute-subtitle bug) and mis-align single
    #    moras (the single-character-fragment bug). Transcribing the real timeline
    #    instead yields tight, coherent segments; non-speech hallucinations are then
    #    removed by _is_nonspeech_ct2_segment against an independent Silero mask.

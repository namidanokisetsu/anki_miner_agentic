    lemma-keyed lookup would poison such spans with citation-form readings):

    1. concatenated kana already attested → keep it (contextual MeCab signal
       wins; only ``kana_attested`` is stamped);
    2. exactly one attested reading → take it;
    3. several → take the one closest to the concatenation by edit distance
       (ties: dictionary score order), so context still steers 四人 to よにん
       rather than the top entry しにん.

    nominalization, whose kana is unidic's context-disambiguated reading, not
    a re-tokenization) are skipped — both outrank the dictionary. Real UniDic
    tokens are never touched (polyphonic 方/中 keep their contextual reading).
    Flags land on ``token.feature`` (a
    ``SimpleNamespace`` — ``SyntheticToken`` declares ``__slots__``):
    ``kana_attested`` on cases 1-3 (``_emit_word`` trusts the token kana), and
    ``kana_overridden`` on cases 2-3 only. The sentence display path carries
    every ``kana_attested`` synthetic so dictionary-backed compound grouping is
    consistent; see ``replace_overridden_spans``. Mutates the synthetic tokens in place —
    they are per-line objects created by the merge passes above. Returns

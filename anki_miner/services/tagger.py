"""Process-wide shared fugashi tagger with lazy, double-checked-locked construction.

The shared tagger is wrapped in a ``LockedTagger`` that serialises every
``tagger(text)`` and ``.parse()`` call with an ``threading.RLock``.  Concurrent
mining sessions (multiple tabs, batch + single, etc.) are therefore safe: each
call acquires the lock, tokenises, then releases.  The single-flight assumption
that previously guarded against MeCab non-reentrancy is **no longer load-bearing**
and has been removed.

The RLock is used (rather than a plain Lock) so that same-thread re-entry
(e.g. nested parse calls on one thread) does not deadlock; cross-thread mutual
exclusion is the primary safety goal.

Background warming via ``gui/workers/prewarm_worker.py`` calls
``get_shared_tagger()`` to pay the unidic-lite / lattice init cost early.
Prewarm intentionally does NOT call ``.parse()`` — it only constructs the tagger.
This is safe: ``get_shared_tagger()`` / wrapper construction is itself guarded by
a separate ``threading.Lock`` (double-checked lock), so concurrent first calls
from multiple threads do not double-build.

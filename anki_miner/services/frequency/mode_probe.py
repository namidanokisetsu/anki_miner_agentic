"""Statistical probe for a frequency source's *direction* (rank- vs occurrence-based).

Rank-based lists (JPDB, BCCWJ) number the *most* frequent word ``1`` — smaller is
more common. Occurrence-based lists store a raw count — *larger* is more common,
so filtering/sorting a card by ``max_frequency_rank`` silently inverts unless the
list is first re-ranked. Yomitan zips can *declare* ``frequencyMode``; plain CSVs
and undeclared zips cannot, so we fall back to the statistical probe below.

The heuristic is a paired-sign vote over two curated 10-term Japanese lists
(known-common vs known-rare). For every common/rare pair that both carry a value
it accumulates ``sign(common.max - rare.min) + sign(common.min - rare.max)``. A
positive total means the common terms hold the *larger* numbers (larger = more
frequent → occurrence-based / ``descending``); negative means the *smaller*
numbers (rank-based / ``ascending``); zero (e.g. no probe terms present) is
ambiguous → ``None``. The pairing makes it robust to partial coverage: a source
that only contains a few of the probe terms still votes with whatever it has.

Ported from Yomitan
``ext/js/pages/settings/sort-frequency-dictionary-controller.js``
(``SortFrequencyDictionaryController._getFrequencyOrder``, lines 154-236) at
upstream commit ``e2ed450``. Term lists and the paired-sign accumulation are
verbatim; the DB round-trip is replaced by a caller-supplied ``lookup``.

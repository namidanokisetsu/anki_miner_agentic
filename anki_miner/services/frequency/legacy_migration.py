"""One-time repair of the legacy frequency source's display name.

A reimport bug collapsed the ``legacy-frequency`` source's display name to the
generic ``"source"`` stem for some users. This module's startup step rewrites
that name back to a friendly label so cards render "Frequency: N" instead of
"source: N". It is idempotent and self-guarded, so it is safe to call on every
startup.

"""Dialogue-only subtitle cleaning for alignment, and mapping results back.

Aligners (alass, ffsubsync) match cue timings against a reference signal.
Anything in a subtitle file that is not dialogue — signs, karaoke, OP/ED
lyrics, ♪ markers, hearing-impaired sound annotations — adds spans that have
nothing to do with speech and can drag the alignment onto a wrong optimum.
The community consensus for anime is unambiguous: strip non-dialogue from
BOTH sides before aligning.

Two sides, two entry points:

* :func:`clean_reference` — the extracted embedded track we align *against*.
  Produces a dialogue-only UTF-8 SRT (text is irrelevant to the aligner, so
  the format is normalized). Moved here from ``retime_reference``.
* :func:`clean_for_alignment` — the user's subtitle being retimed. Produces a
  same-format copy with non-dialogue cues *dropped* (never rewritten) and
  records which original cues survived, so the computed timings can be mapped
  back onto the untouched original with :func:`map_deltas_back` — every line
  and all ASS styling survive the round trip.

Nothing here raises for content reasons: an unparsable file returns None /
False and the caller falls back to aligning the original directly.

"""Best-effort background warming of MeCab + the dictionary chain.

On the FIRST Mine click the app builds services on the GUI thread, which
constructs ``fugashi.Tagger()`` (loads unidic-lite, ~0.5-2s) and opens every
installed dictionary's SQLite index. That freezes the first Mine for seconds.

This worker warms the relevant process/OS caches in a background thread right
after the main window first paints, so the first real Mine is materially
faster. It is *pure best-effort*:

- It builds (or warms, if already built) the SHARED ``get_shared_tagger()``
  singleton so the unidic-lite load + lattice init is paid here, on the
  shared tagger that mining actually reuses — not on a throwaway instance.
  Construction is double-checked-locked, so warming it from this thread while
  the GUI thread may also call ``get_shared_tagger()`` is safe.  The returned
  ``LockedTagger`` serialises concurrent ``.parse()`` / ``__call__`` calls via
  an ``threading.RLock``, so the old single-flight assumption is no longer
  load-bearing.  Prewarm still does NOT run a warm ``.parse()``; it only pays
  the construction cost.
- For the dictionary chain it constructs a THROWAWAY ``DictionaryRegistry`` to
  force the sqlite page cache / meta sidecars into memory, then discards it —
  cross-thread sqlite connection reuse during a live mine is needless risk.
- A failure inside :meth:`run` (e.g. missing MeCab dict in some env) is
  swallowed and logged, never crashing the app.

If the user clicks Mine before this finishes, behavior is exactly today's cold
path — there is no shared state and no synchronization with the mining path.

Completion is signalled via the built-in ``QThread.finished`` signal, which Qt
emits whenever :meth:`run` returns (every exit path), so callers can drop their
GC reference to the worker safely. We deliberately do not declare a custom
``finished`` ``pyqtSignal`` (that would shadow ``QThread.finished``, which the
codebase relies on for cleanup wiring — see ``import_worker``).

"""Worker thread for the deck-builder aggregate → preview → build flow.

Runs the whole deck build off the GUI thread in two phases separated by a
confirm gate:

1. **Aggregate + preview** — combine per-file lemma counts across the request's
   file pairs, compute the candidate selection plus a :class:`DeckBuildPreview`,
   emit the preview, then BLOCK on ``self._confirm_event`` until the GUI calls
   :meth:`confirm` or :meth:`reject` (or the worker is cancelled).
2. **Build** (only if confirmed) — ensure the deck exists, then mine each
   episode through the EXISTING ``EpisodeProcessor.process_episode`` pipeline,
   routing cards to the named deck and carding each selected lemma exactly once
   across the whole batch (cross-episode dedup via the curation callback).

        always unioned in, matching the build's always-applied user list.

        * Key space: corpus lemmas are keyed by dictionary lemma, while Anki
          known-words are keyed by ``mined_form`` (surface form for nouns), so
          ``known_skipped`` is approximate.
        * Live-Anki sync: when the DB path is taken this returns the cached
          ``get_known_words()`` only, whereas the build additionally syncs live
          Anki vocab per episode. With a stale DB the build subtracts MORE, so
          it can produce fewer cards than the preview promised.

        The EXACT known-words filtering happens during the build via the
        existing Phase-2 path (collection_filter ON → ``include_known_words=
        False``). We do not reconcile the two here.

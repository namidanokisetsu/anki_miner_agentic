"""The System Health destination (decision D26).

A wizard establishes facts that go stale the moment it closes: Anki gets shut
down, dictionaries need reimporting after an upgrade, yt-dlp ages out. Until
now the only route back was re-running the wizard, so this screen exists
permanently instead — every readiness fact the app has, when it last checked,
and a button that jumps to the control that repairs it.

Three rules shape it.

* **A check that has not run is not a failure.** Every row starts *unknown* and
  stays unknown until something reports. This is also true *within* a sweep:
  the deck, note type and field checks are skipped entirely when AnkiConnect is
  unreachable, so painting them red would invent three failures out of one.
* **The window observes; it never owns a worker.** It renders whatever the last
  ``BackgroundTaskController`` result said and asks for a re-check by signal.
  Closing it cancels nothing, and a result that lands while it is hidden is
  still there when it reopens, because the report lives on the main window.
* **Fix is a deep link, not a re-implementation.** A row knows one stable
  setting-anchor id (D11) and emits it. Resolving that to a tab, a page, a
  scroll position and a focused widget stays entirely in ``SettingsTab``.

"""Video container tab — nests Single, Batch, and YouTube as inner tabs.

Wraps :class:`~anki_miner.gui.widgets.single_episode_tab.SingleEpisodeTab`
(Single), :class:`~anki_miner.gui.widgets.batch_processing_tab.BatchProcessingTab`
(Batch), and :class:`~anki_miner.gui.widgets.youtube_tab.YouTubeTab` (YouTube)
inside a single top-level tab so the main tab bar stays uncluttered. This
container only routes config refreshes, shutdown, dictionary-release, and
sub-tab reveal down to the children; each child keeps its own worker lifecycle.

Close contract (differs from ``ReadingTab`` — read before changing):
- ``shutdown()`` fans out to ALL THREE children, each guarded independently:
  an exception raised while stopping one child must not strand another child's
  still-running worker at app close.
- Timing: only YouTube joins its worker inline (``YouTubeTab.shutdown`` bounded
  ``wait()`` at ``_SHUTDOWN_WAIT_MS`` = 2s; on join-OK it nulls ``worker_thread``,
  but on timeout it RETAINS the handle — same deferred-close design as
  Single/Batch). Single/Batch inherit the ``MiningTabBase`` ``shutdown()``
  which poisons the curation gate WITHOUT joining — their live workers are
  cancelled+joined later by the controller at ``_CLOSE_JOIN_GRACE_MS`` (2s
  each), so worst-case close is ~2s inline join + 2x2s deferred grace
  (~6s total).
- Ordering: YouTube's inline join runs before Single/Batch workers are
  cancelled. No deadlock — the base ``shutdown()`` gate-poison *unparks* a
  curation-blocked worker rather than cancelling it, so nothing waits on a
  worker that cannot make progress.
- NO ``worker_thread`` attribute on the container, but — unlike ``ReadingTab``
  — it DOES expose ``iter_close_workers()``. Nested, the controller's
  top-level ``getattr(tab, "worker_thread", None)`` probe hits the container
  and yields ``None``, and the Single/Batch base ``shutdown()`` never joins
  their workers; without ``iter_close_workers`` those live workers would be
  destroyed mid-run at close.
  :class:`~anki_miner.gui.controllers.background_tasks.BackgroundTaskController`
  routes each yielded worker through the same cancel → bounded-join →
  laggard-deferral policy they got as top-level tabs. YouTube's worker is
  naturally skipped: its own ``shutdown()`` already joined and nulled it. Child
  iterators also surface nested workers such as retained YouTube probe threads.

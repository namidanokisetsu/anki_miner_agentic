#
# Measured in the combo's own font on every set_profiles rather than frozen as
# pixels: the 12-character hint alone is 160px at ui_font_scale 1.0 but 256px at

# Same character budget for the theme combo, and for the same reason: without it

# combo's 232px at ui_font_scale 1.5 on DejaVu Sans). That pushed the header
# minimum to 1028px -- past the 1024px WINDOW_MIN_WIDTH the window sets on
# itself -- on any desktop whose default sans face is Latin-only, because DejaVu
# advances run wider than Noto Sans CJK JP's for the same string.
#
# Capping the CLOSED combo costs nothing: the sentinel is never the closed text.
# Picking it opens Settings and snaps the selection straight back to the active
# theme, so the closed combo only ever shows a theme name. The drop-down keeps
# sizing to its widest item (291px against the 260px combo at 1.5x), so the
# sentinel stays readable where it is actually read.
#
# The same 12 as the profile combo, so the two selectors stack to one width.
# Measured: 12 and 10 land on the same 232px -- the style's own minimum binds
# first -- so this is the larger budget of the two that cost nothing.

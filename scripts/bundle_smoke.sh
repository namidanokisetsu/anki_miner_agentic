# --- 2b. whisper.cpp (pywhispercpp Vulkan) IMPORT/LOADABILITY gate -------------
# IMPORT/LOADABILITY ONLY. This proves the from-source Vulkan pywhispercpp wheel
# replaced the CPU wheel and was collected into the frozen tree, and that the
# bundled binary can load the ggml/whisper native chain far enough to return an
# integer Vulkan device count. It proves NOTHING about Vulkan transcription: the
# CI runners have no GPU, so the device count is expected to be 0 (CPU fallback)
# and a real GPU transcription pass can only be validated manually on hardware.
#
# Four cheap, GPU-free assertions, all fail-closed (the (c) decode is GPU-free by
# construction — it forces the CPU backend on a GPU-less runner):
#   (a) the ggml-vulkan backend MODULE is present in the bundle (libggml-vulkan*
#       on Linux / ggml-vulkan*.dll on Windows). Its presence is what makes
#       _engine.whisper_cpp_available() report a GPU-capable build; if the wheel
#       replacement or the hook collection silently failed, this lib is missing
#       and the bundle would be a CPU-only build masquerading as Vulkan.
#   (a2) the ggml-cpu backend MODULE is present (libggml-cpu* / ggml-cpu.dll). It
#       is a separate GGML_BACKEND_DL module (NOT compiled into libggml-base);
#       absent means whisper.cpp cannot fall back to CPU when no Vulkan device
#       exists (DEFECT 2). File-presence only, no Model creation.
#   (b) the frozen binary's hidden Vulkan probe (ANKI_MINER_ASR_VULKAN_PROBE=1,
#       app.main routes it to _vulkan_probe before any Qt init) runs the cold
#       ctypes load of ggml-vulkan in a child and prints the device count — a
#       single integer on stdout, exit 0. This is exactly the value
#       _engine.vulkan_device_count() parses, so a clean integer here is the
#       "isinstance(vulkan_device_count(), int)" loadability gate.
#   (c) the frozen binary actually `import pywhispercpp.model`s (via
#       ANKI_MINER_SMOKE=whispercpp -> _run_whispercpp_bundled_smoke, which calls
#       get_whisper_cpp_model_cls()). This is the REAL runtime import path the
#       Vulkan engine takes — pywhispercpp.model pulls pywhispercpp.constants
#       (-> platformdirs) and pywhispercpp.utils (-> requests, tqdm) at module
#       load. Neither (a) the filesystem find nor (b) the ctypes probe imports
#       pywhispercpp.model, so only (c) catches a transitive runtime dep missing
#       from the bundle env (e.g. platformdirs not installed) or a frozen
#       find_spec.origin failure. When BUNDLE_SMOKE_GGML_MODEL points at a ggml
#       acoustic file, (c) ALSO constructs a Model + runs a minimal CPU-backend
#       decode — the only assertion that catches DEFECT 1 (no ggml_backend_load_all
#       -> SIGABRT) and DEFECT 2's runtime effect (no CPU fallback). With no model
#       set, (c) is IMPORT/LOADABILITY ONLY — no GPU, no decode.
#
# Skipped on macOS (BOTH arm64 and Intel): macOS stays on the CT2/Metal path and
# ships no Vulkan pywhispercpp wheel, so none of these assertions apply. Set

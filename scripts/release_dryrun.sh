# Release dry-run gate.
#
# Dispatches .github/workflows/release.yml against the CURRENT branch, which
# builds the REAL release matrix (PyInstaller + from-source Vulkan wheel +
# Inno/AppImage/deb/tar) and runs the bundle smokes — but by construction creates
# NO tag, NO GitHub Release, and NO PyPI upload (only a v* TAG push does that).
# After a green build it PROVES those negatives (release/ci-gate jobs skipped, no
# Release object, Vulkan smoke actually executed). Exits nonzero on any red.
# Re-run and fix until "RELEASE DRY-RUN GREEN" before cutting a release.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release_dryrun.sh [linux-windows|all|linux|windows|macos]
#     default: linux-windows  (cheap; covers 4 of 6 historical failure classes).
#     Run `all` ONCE, green, immediately before tagging — only `all` builds the
#     10x-billed mac legs that prove the mac runner labels still resolve.
#
# Requires: gh authenticated with scopes: actions:write + actions:read +
#           contents:read (classic `repo`). The contents/release scope is needed
#           by the `gh release list` and release-job assertions below.
#
# Preconditions (both must hold, they are DISTINCT):
#   (a) the dispatch-enabled release.yml must be on the DEFAULT branch (main) —
#       GitHub only honors workflow_dispatch for a workflow on the default branch;
#   (b) the branch under test must be PUSHED to origin — `gh workflow run --ref`
#       resolves server-side; a local-only branch 404s.
#
# Overlapping dispatches on the same branch are unsupported (concurrency queues
# them); wait for / cancel a prior run before re-dispatching.
